# OCRLab

Learning project for OCR and image processing.

## Overview

This project practices Optical Character Recognition (OCR) by extracting text from images using Tesseract.

## Learning Objectives

- Tesseract.NET setup and configuration
- Image preprocessing (grayscale, thresholding)
- OCR text extraction
- Confidence scoring
- Field extraction with Regex
- Batch processing

## Project Flow

```
1. Load image files
2. Preprocess images (grayscale, threshold)
3. Run OCR with Tesseract
4. Extract structured data
5. Export results to CSV/JSON
```

## Deliverables

- Functional OCR pipeline
- Image preprocessing
- Text extraction
- Structured data export
